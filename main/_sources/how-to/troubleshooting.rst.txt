Troubleshooting
===============

EDM Fonts
---------

If you want to use edm then you will need to have the local fonts on your
host machine. These will eventually be provided by default on the standard DLS 
RHEL8 workstation. However, early adopters will need to install these
themselves.

Use ``sudo yum install`` on each of the rpms in this folder
https://github.com/dls-controls/dev-c7/tree/dev/edm-fonts

VSCode Container Removal
------------------------

If you want to remove all of the containers that VSCode has created then the 
following will do the trick::

    podman rmi -f $(podman images --filter=reference='*vsc-*' -q)

This may be useful if you are having trouble with VSCode devcontainers or
if you are running low on disk space.

Insufficient UIDs/GIDs
----------------------

When building the container for the first time, you may come across the following:
```
Error: writing blob: adding layer with blob 
"sha256:0b2dc63a68b9b80b6e261e0c71119894a739d353f8263d6b2f1394c66a45f5af": ApplyLayer exit status 1 stdout:  
stderr: potentially insufficient UIDs or GIDs available in user namespace (requested 0:54 for /run/lock/lockdev): 
Check /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid: lchown /run/lock/lockdev: invalid argument
```

Rootless Podman uses a pause process to preserve the unprivileged namespaces, which locks down the user files /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid.
The following command will stop the pause process and release the files for editing::

    podman system migrate

First Terminal in VSCode
------------------------
When using vscode and the devcontainer the first terminal will usually NOT
have run your login profile (.bash_profile).

To work around this, close and reopen the 1st terminal or type::

    bash -l
