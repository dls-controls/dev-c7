.. _deriving:

Derive your own container image
===============================

Each developer is free to derive their own container image if they have 
specific requirements e.g.

- Additional system libraries
- Additional command line or GUI tools
- Any other OS configuration that they prefer

.. note::
    If the changes you need are likely to be useful to all developers then
    you should consider contributing to the base image for dev-c7.
    See `../reference/contributing`
